bidder is trained using random tipping between 0 and 20% of budget.
for evaluation, on off and simple runs last 5k ticks.
The problem with this model is that while normal bidding is deterministic,
tipping is random (a random tip is chosen between 0 and 20% of budget).
Need to train another model that uses the same tipping strategy as bidding
(tip is budget/encounters, then the bidder can apply a discount based on prediction).
